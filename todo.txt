lexer and parser
----------------
power
allow trailing comma
semicolons multiple expressions
localized decimal separator in numbers
disambigation operator
single quotes to escape variable names
full grammar for identifiers

engineering
-----------
- use let and const
- pointer to parent in the parse tree
- clean up prim - remove duplicate code - be consistent with look ahead and helpers
- pointers to underlying tokens (and therefore index)
- parse tree operator type (note hack of adding spaces on ' and ' and ' or ')
- parse tree operator printing
- partial expression resolution
- tests for unconsumed tokens scenarios
- tests with chai
